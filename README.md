## Project Overview
Concrete strength prediction is essential in construction projects to ensure the material meets safety and performance standards. This project uses traditional machine learning techniques to predict concrete compressive strength based on data from concrete mix design and material properties.

The project leverages different machine learning models, evaluates their performance, and compares the results to select the best model for the task.

## Features
- Predict compressive strength based on concrete mix design features
- Models include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting
- Model comparison based on performance metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Visualizations for feature importance and model performance
